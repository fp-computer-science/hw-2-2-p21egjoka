Answer the following question in a Python file named `hw2-2.py`. In your heading, put your name and the date you began working on the file. Be sure to write the program in a way that allows you to swap values to make the program more versatile.


In basketball, there are there ways to score points:

* A free throw is worth 1 point.
* A basket inside the three point line is worth 2 points.
* A basket beyond the three point line is worth 3 points.

Create a program that will calculate the number of points scored in a game if you input the number of free throws, 2 point baskets and 3 point baskets the player had in a game.

Your program should print the following statement:

`The player scored ## points in the game.`

Where the `##` is replaced by the number of points your program calculated. You can set a value for the number of each type of basket that was scored to test the program.
